{"name":"Neu Berliner","tagline":"A lightweight framework for Coffeescript apps.","body":"## Neu Berliner\r\n\r\nInspired heavily by Berliner, another framework doing the same thing. The idea is to write quick web apps in Coffeescript. \r\n\r\n### Sample\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example:\r\n\r\n```coffeescript\r\n\r\napp = require 'neu-berliner'\r\n\r\napp.get '/', -> 'Hello, world!'\r\n\r\napp.run 4567\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFairly simple, as you can see. You can find some more details [here](https://github/com/rudimk/neu-berliner).\r\n\r\n### Future plans\r\n\r\nNone, for now, although the library may be tested with io.js, and possibly even extended, to make sure it's compatible.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
